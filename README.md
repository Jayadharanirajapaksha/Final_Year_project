# Final_Year_project
This is my Final Year project. This is a research based and innovative project which explores cultural, architectural and water engineering technology in ancient Sigiriya with meta-humans.<br>
Project Objectives:<br>
1. Survey on Sigiriya.(I visited and have researched about Sigiriya for 4 months at the beginning of this project.<br>
2. Design the water garden environment of Ancient Sigiriya.<br>
3. Develope the water engineering technology behind the water gardens in ancient Sigiriya.<br>
4. Create the cultural and architectural environment of ancient Sigiriya using “MetaHuman.”<br>

I'm currently working in this project and This project will explore the cultural, architectural and water engineering technology of ancient Sigiriya using Metaverse technology. According to the project objectives, first will create the physical environment of water gardens in ancient Sigiriya. Then design the water engineering system to demonstrate the water engineering technology of the water gardens. Create the cultural and architectural environment of ancient Sigiriya using MetaHman. <br>

The use of Metaverse technology can provide an immersive and interactive experience in a high level regardless of the physical or sensory abilities. The motivation for this project is to explore the cultural, architectural environment and water engineering technology of ancient Sigiriya using metaverse technology and Meta human. As well as this project creates a virtual tour for disable people who can explore the Ancient Sigiriya using Metaverse technology in a safe and accessible manner using a VR headset and experiencing the beauty and the history of Sigiriya including time travelling to the ancient Sigiriya with hands on experience. There are limited researches are available on use of Metaverse technology for disable people. When we consider about the Sri Lankan researches, it is a new chapter to the Sri Lankan technology. As well as this project can apply for various industries such as tourism, healthcare, education, entertainment and film industry, etc.<br>
Therefore at the end of this project, I hope to publish a Research paper and introduce this product to the market as well.
